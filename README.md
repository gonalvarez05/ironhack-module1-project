# Data jobs in Europe

 In the first project of the Ironhack bootcamp we had to develop a Data Pipeline with the most data jobs in each country of Europe.
 
 We had to get the different data from three data sources (Database, API, Web Scraping), then merged the different tables and finally get our result.
